Sketchiness

A Figma plugin that will take your primitive shapes (rectangles, circles, triangles, etc.) and make them look more rough or sketchy. 

How to Use?
Simply select a single or multiple element inside a frame, or select the whole frame. Then go to Plugins > Sketchiness. The simple elements that are in your selection will be converted to vector objects and given sketchiness.
