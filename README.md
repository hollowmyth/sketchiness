Sketchiness

A Figma plugin that will take your primitive shapes (rectangles, circles, triangles, etc.) and make them look more rough or sketchy. 

**How to Use?**

Simply select a single element, multiple elements, or select the whole frame. Then go to Plugins > Sketchiness. The simple elements that are in your selection will be converted to vector objects and given sketchiness.
